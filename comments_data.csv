@markwincostante5579,0,"I had a feeling of longing and of wanting a person so badly, and this song simply reminds me the moment we knew each other was the moment where the entire universe conspired to help me find this person.

@MisingHome98,0,"2024 now, and here I am"
@BenjaminKibbey,0,"So. Spontaneous. I&#39;m thinking. <br><br>I&#39;ve been married. I&#39;ve been in love as many times as I&#39;ve had my heart broken. When I was too old to do dumb things, a moment came when someone had to do something, had to be the person who walked in and stood up for someone.<br><br>I was not strong enough. I was not prepared enough. I did not have the resources. I was not the right person for the job by any stretch. <br><br>But, someone needed to be there, and I could. <br><br>I will carry the scars of the years that followed for the rest of my life. Actual war did not give me PTSD. Trying to keep kids and their mom safe from the family courts, from social workers, and from a vengeful and petty man who&#39;d rather burn people down than not own them, I ended up with what is probably PTSD, at least plenty of anxiety-related symptoms that were not there before. <br><br>And in the end, I wasn&#39;t the right man, but I got to be there and fight the fight worth fighting. <br><br>I would not take back a day. I would not go back and tell the man packing up and leaving his life behind that it was the wrong choice. <br><br>For all the hurt and loneliness that follows, there were such unbelievable moments of brightness and hope. There are three boys who don&#39;t have to wait to find out if he&#39;ll strangle them again or if the deputies will ignore the ligature marks on a child&#39;s neck again. They don&#39;t have to listen to social workers going out of their way to make every excuse and apology on behalf of a man who will never apologize, or a judge tell them to shut up and take it. <br><br>So, yah. Not just the romantic risks or the profitable risks. Take the sacrificial risks. Take the dangerous risks. Go to war. Fight the fights. Be the one who walks out scarred and bruised from standing up in a war that wasn&#39;t ever yours. Because someone needs to be, and because it&#39;s never the wrong choice."
@GilangJanwar,1,I love you mom‚ù§
@noahholland6804,3,"For anyone struggling. I love you. Just because you exist. <br><br>You may be lost, feel alone, and have no idea what to do with yourself.<br><br> I&#39;ve been there, and I&#39;m still alive. People care. Even when you can&#39;t see it yourself. I promise you they do.<br><br>I hope someone hugs you so tight and kisses the top of your head with love."
@brandenjohnson4884,0,If you are lucky enough to find true love and loyalty you found more riches than any Vault of gold
@jitugad,1,"This song makes me realise, how much lonely I'm in life and what all I'm missing in life. <br>All those who have a partner, please respect  the relation and  enjoy with your partner, give them time as far as you can. You never know when it&#39;s the last."
